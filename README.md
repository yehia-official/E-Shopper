# 🛍️ E-Shopper

Just launched my **first frontend project** — *E-Shopper*, a clean and simple eCommerce layout!

## 📌 About the Project

I got the idea from my friend **Mustafa Ahmed**, inspired by *Baby Amazon*.

This project helped me understand how real-world UI components are structured, and gave me hands-on experience with layout, styling, and responsive design.

## 🔧 What I Used

- ✅ **Bootstrap** — for layout & responsiveness  
- ✅ **Google Fonts** — for better typography  
- ✅ **Ready-made UI** — to learn from a solid design structure
