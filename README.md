## 🏗️ Architecture

As a static project, the architecture is straightforward. The browser directly loads the HTML files and their linked assets (CSS, JS, images).

**Current Static Architecture:**
```
            +-----------------+
            |   Web Browser   |
            | (User's Device) |
            +-------+---------+
                    |
      +-------------+-------------+
      |             |             |
+-----v------+ +----v-----+ +-----v----+
| index.html | | style.css| |  main.js |
+------------+ +----------+ +----------+
```

**Future MERN Stack Architecture:**

The application is designed to be extended into a full-stack architecture where the frontend (rebuilt in React) communicates with a backend server via a REST API.

```
+-----------------+      +--------------------+      +----------------------+      +---------------+
| Client (React)  |----->| REST API Endpoints |----->| Server (Node/Express)|----->| DB (MongoDB)  |
| (Browser)       |<-----| (e.g., /api/...)   |<-----| (Business Logic)     |<-----| (Data Storage)|
+-----------------+      +--------------------+      +----------------------+      +---------------+
```
